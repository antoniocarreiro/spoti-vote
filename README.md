# spoti-vote
Web application to vote for the next song in Spotify Queue

# Project Description:

The idea for this project resulted as we have a Spotify class playlist with great songs we listen to in our breaks.
The problem with it was that Spotify's shuffling feature didn't please the majority of the class.
To solve this problem I thought about creating a website where users could choose between four to eight songs (depending on the settings). The song with the most votes would be added to the queue as next song.

## Requirements:
* [Node v6.0 and higher](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Spotify Premium Account](https://www.spotify.com/at/) for the DJ

## Usage

To use my webpage, you first want to download [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).
You also have to install and configure [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/).
If your on ubuntu you can easily install it with `sudo apt-get install nginx`.
To configure NGINX you have to open up `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`, and add a server with three locations.
Heres an example:
```
server {
    listen 80;

    server_name YOUR_EXTERNAL_IP_ADDRESS;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://YOUR_PRIVATE_IP_ADDRESS:FRONTEND_PORT;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }

    location /b {
        proxy_pass http://YOUR_PRIVATE_IP_ADDRESS:BACKEND_PORT;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }

    location /socket.io {
        proxy_pass http://YOUR_PRIVATE_IP_ADDRESS:BACKEND_PORT;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

Then clone my repository using:\
`git clone https://github.com/Gabsii/spoti-vote.git`

The following Environment Variables are key for the usage of this app. You want to set them using `SET` on Windows or `EXPORT` on a OSX. If this doesn't work try to set them in `/etc/environment`.
```
PORT=8080
PORTBACK=8888
INTERNALADDRESS="localhost"
PORTOUTSIDE=80
ADDRESS="spoti-vote.com"
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID="FOO"
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET="BAR"
```
After successfully cloning the repository, you want to startup a commandline in its folder and run `npm install` in:
```
.
+-- spoti-vote
|   +-- execute command here
+-- spoti-vote-backend
|   +-- execute command here
```
then manover back to the root folder and run:
```
npm install pm2 -g
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
```
Thanks to [MPJ](https://github.com/mpj/oauth-bridge-template) for providing a framework for the backend-logic.

Congratulations! You now are able to use my webpage.
